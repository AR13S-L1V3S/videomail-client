videomail-client
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/binarykitchen/videomail-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/binarykitchen/videomail-client)

A revolutionary node module which enables you to record videos directly in the browser, wohooo! This without the need for Flash, Java nor anything else.

All it needs is the Videomail API (www.videomail.io) which does the video encoding for you.

*UNFINISHED VERSION!*

## TODO

* Also combine common styles
* Try to use CSS classes instead
