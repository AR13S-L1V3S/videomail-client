================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/binarykitchen/videomail-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/binarykitchen/videomail-client)

A revolutionary node.js module which enables you to record videos directly in the browser, wohooo! This without the need for Flash, Java nor anything else.

All it needs is the Videomail API (www.videomail.io) which does the video encoding for you. Just contact me to add your URL in a whitelist.

*UNFINISHED VERSION!*

** Examples

Just do a `npm install`, then run `gulp examples` to ignite a static server to serve examples on `http://localhost:8080`
